# 📋 Website Reorganization Summary

## ✅ Changes Made:

### **New Page Order** (Better UX):

1. **Hero Section** - First impression
2. **Services Section** ← MOVED UP (was #7)
   - People want to see what you offer immediately!
3. **Instagram Feed** - Show your work
4. **FAQ** - Answer common questions
5. **Testimonials** - Social proof
6. **Before & After Gallery** - Visual results
7. **Contact** - Get in touch
8. **About/Our Story** ← MOVED DOWN (was #3)
   - Still accessible via "About" link in navigation
   - Not the main focus for first-time visitors

## 🎯 Why This Order Works Better:

### **Services First:**

- ✅ Visitors immediately see what you offer
- ✅ Can browse packages and pricing info
- ✅ Encourages them to call for appointments
- ✅ Most important information up front

### **About Last:**

- ✅ Nice to have, but not critical for booking
- ✅ Still accessible via navigation menu
- ✅ People who want to learn more can scroll down
- ✅ Keeps the focus on services and results

## 📱 User Journey:

1. **Land on page** → See beautiful hero
2. **Scroll down** → "What do they offer?" → **Services!**
3. **Keep scrolling** → See Instagram photos
4. **Questions?** → FAQ section
5. **Still interested?** → Read testimonials
6. **Want to book?** → Contact section
7. **Curious about the salon?** → About section

---

## 🔗 Navigation Still Works:

The "About" link in the navigation menu will still jump directly to the About section - it's just lower on the page now.

---

**This is standard for service-based websites!** Services come early, story comes later. 🎯
